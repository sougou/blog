# About Me

Hi, I'm **Sugu Sougoumarane**, Head of Multigres at [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

## Background

I returned from a three-year sabbatical to work on [Multigres](https://multigres.com). Due to this, many of my blog contributions are on that site. But I may post any opinionated thoughts here.

I previously co-founded PlanetScale, which was based on [Vitess](https://vitess.io), a project I co-created while at Google/YouTube.

I'm also an indirect co-inventor of [FlexPaxos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06696).
